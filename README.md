# NationalParkMenuApp
This app is a simple menu for a list of National Parks.
It reads date from a JSON file and allows the user to edit the data then it writes the data back out to the JSON file.
It displays a list of national parks and allows the user to either add a new park, delete a park, or edit any of the park names or locations (states).
The user must enter the park location number in order to edit or delete.
The location number is a four letter abbreviation that can be found in the list of parks, right next the park name and state.
